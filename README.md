## Download ðŸ”½  
Check out the [releases](https://github.com/GlueGunStanley/Radiance/releases) page for the latest version.

## Installation âœ…  
**1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/GlueGunStanley/Radiance/releases).**  
**2. Extract and rename the folder to `Radiance`.**  
**3. Drag `Radiance` into your `resources` folder.**  
**4. Go to your `server.cfg` and add `start Radiance`.**  
**5. Configure the resource by selecting a preset (`bright` , `brighter` or `normal`).**  

That's it! If everything went correctly, the next time you start your server, Radiance will automatically enhance emergency lighting.

## Configuration ðŸ”§  
Radiance comes with two preset options: 
- **`normal`** (default) â€“ More natural brightness while still improving default lighting.  
- **`bright`** â€“ Enhances emergency lighting for maximum visibility.  
- **`brighter`** â€“ For if bright is not enough and you feel like being blinded.  

To change the preset, modify `fxmanifest.lua` inside the resource folder:  
```lua
preset 'normal' -- Change if preferred
```
Radiance will automatically apply the selected preset.

## Performance âž°  
Radiance has **zero** noticeable impact on performance, as it simply adjusts existing visual settings.
